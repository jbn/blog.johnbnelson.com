Summary: Creators tend to grossly overvalue their product ideas, compelled by fantasy.

### TL;DR Version:

For product, $X$, in the universe of products, most of the time:

$$
\require{color}
\definecolor{red}{RGB}{255,0,0}
P(\text{is_viable}(X)) \lt P(\text{is_viable}(X) \mid \text{scratches_itch}(X))$$

But, the part people seem to forget is,

$$P(\text{is_viable}(X) \mid \text{scratches_itch}(X)) \color{red} \lt 1$$


### Verbose Version [1]

"Scratch your own itch." Prescribed as a heuristic for entrepreneurs searching for a product, it means build something that you yourself need. It can be a good heuristic. You're not that special -- if you have identified something you need, it's reasonable to assume other people have a similar need. Except, it's only a good heuristic for building a business if you are good at assessing your product's *value*. This is challenging if you have not learned to temper the instinct to fantasize. 

Assume that you have just identified a product that you want, in the abstract sense. That is, you find it attractive at the moment of conception. Propelled by the desire to create, to build, and *to be rewarded*, you draw increasingly elaborate visions for the success of your product. You plot a fantastical path between now and your incipient empire. The future is rosy. 

Then, with palpable trepidation, you do a cursory search to see if anyone else has had your brilliant idea. They have; they've already built it; and, it's better than what you envisioned. Their product scratches your itch perfectly and gives you a back-rub as well. 

**...and, you don't buy it...**

Why? 

Partially, your sense of value may be momentarily skewed due to a form of [anchoring bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring). You were thinking that this product would mean a billion dollar valuation. With that fantasy and its concomitant hopes deflated, it's difficult to maintain rationality. In the mathematical sense, the benefit of their product may exceed the cost -- but your utilitarian calculus isn't operating correctly. Any benefits seem insignificant now, not worth the time to acquire. A poor man picks pennies up from the ground; a rich man does not, and moments ago, you fancied yourself a soon-to-be-rich man.

Still, ignoring the anchoring effects, there is a more obvious (and probable) explanation for your failure to "scratch your itch" by buying their product -- **the product isn't actually valuable to you**. It's not even that valuable to anyone else. It's just a novelty that became a vehicle for fantasy. So, while "scratching your itch" may be a good course heading when navigating the space of possible products, it is not magical. You still need to Think Hard &#0153; and engage in skepticism.[2] There are many more unviable products than viable ones, even after filtering for those that you (seemingly) need.[3]

[3] Thanks to [@RaananKagan](https://twitter.com/RaananKagan) for providing feedback on the first pass of this post, prior to publication. Also, thanks to [@DannyHorowitz](https://twitter.com/DannyHorowitz) for feedback on the second, and for pointing out the value of iteration and testing. Although I didn't want to include it in the main body of this post for fear of diluting my main argument, if you are continuously testing your idea against customers, you're essentially hill-climbing the product space. This practice can be yet another tool for squeezing out the unviable in favor of the viable.
